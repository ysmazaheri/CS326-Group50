                UMass Study Bites is a food delivery app that is targeted toward students on the UMass Amherst 
                flagship campus and that deals exclusively with on-campus dining hall food. Study Bites will 
                allow users to order food from a given dining hall through a live UMass menu, and then have the 
                food delivered to their dorm. This project aims to be an all-in-one, intuitive place for students 
                to find out what is being served around campus, as well as get that food brought to them in an organized 
                way. Right now, if you are a student who is sick or injured in a significant way, it can be very 
                difficult to get to a dining hall, and in the process, you risk getting others sick or further injuring 
                yourself. This app intends to help students in these situations get their food safely and without all 
                the hassle. Additionally, during midterms and finals, waiting in dining hall lines eats up a lot of 
                potential studying time. This app helps students get food conveniently, allowing them to spend their 
                limited time on more demanding tasks.

                <h2>Application Parts</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="main-body">
                The first critical component of Study Bites is the selection of a delivery location 
                from a predetermined list. At release, Study Bites will limit delivery locations to 
                UMass Amherst dining halls, with the potential to scale the app to other on-campus 
                locations if popularity increases.
                <br>
                A second major part of Study Bites is the dining hall food selection. Our app will pull 
                both the Grab-n-Go and dine-in menus of all 4 dining halls. The user ordering food will 
                be able to click any of these locations and easily view its corresponding menu. The menus 
                will be consistent with the UMass Dining app’s current listings, extracting their data from 
                a common source. From this menu, the receiving user can select up to four desired items 
                from their specified dining hall—thereby abiding by UMass Grab-n-Go restrictions and ensuring 
                that the deliveries are reasonably sized for carrying.

                <br>
                Another critical component of the app is the delivery service. Because UMass dining halls largely 
                rely on dining plans that are accessed via UCards, involving non-UMass Amherst students in the 
                system adds an unneeded layer of complexity. Similarly, converting the meal swipes expended in picking 
                up food to USD that the ordering user pays becomes a difficult conversion. Instead, Study Bites relies 
                on a token system, where all users start with one token. Delivering food to a student allows users to 
                gain tokens, which they can then spend to get food delivered to themselves. Securing this UMass-Amherst 
                student token system is the requirement that Study Bites accounts be made with a UMass email, thereby 
                ensuring that students don’t create multiple accounts for free tokens, especially those without meal 
                plans. Delivery to the correct student is confirmed by the displaying of the recipient’s UCard.

            <div class="main-title">
                <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="main-body">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the account system of Study Bites, the web app will 
                need to handle user data. Necessary data will include the student’s name as appears 
                on their UCard so that deliveries are given to the correct student, the student’s phone 
                number, and student email to connect deliverers and recipients. Additionally, the app 
                will store students’ commonly used addresses, and the number of orders they have placed 
                and delivered, to make future orders easier. Only essential user information will be 
                stored, with Study Bites taking special care to not store sensitive information, such as 
                Spire IDs. Even with this avoidance of highly sensitive information, Study Bites will need 
                to take special precautions to keep user data secure and to use the information responsibly. 
                Study Bites will also provide an avenue through which users can have their stored information 
                removed and their accounts deleted, thus ensuring that the web app is non-committal.

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Study Bites revolves around delivering food between specified locations, 
                its user interface is highly enhanced by the use of locational data. With Study Bites, this data will 
                manifest itself on the user interface through a map feature, likely implemented through an API such as 
                that provided by Google Maps. Through this map feature, users can navigate through delivery location and 
                dining hall options in a more visually appealing manner than scrolling through a long list. This map also 
                allows for the future implementation of delivery time estimates. Because geocoding, the conversion of 
                addresses or location names into coordinate values, is a process that many providers charge for, the 
                enumerated addresses of pick-up and delivery locations will be preemptively geocoded before release. In 
                the future, a larger budget may allow for individuals to pin delivery locations or use their current location 
                as the delivery point.
                Study Bites can also use trends in order data to improve its user experience. By keeping a list of orders 
                placed within a determined length of time, Study Bites can observe what menu items have been popular at 
                dining halls. Through this feature, students who regularly order said popular item will have an easier time 
                adding it to their order, and students who may not have tried it before will be encouraged to try what other 
                students are recommending. Similarly, Study Bites can note what menu items are often ordered in combination. 
                Whether the items are ordered together because the flavors pair well—such as a burger and fries—or because 
                they combine to form one dish—such as cereal and milk—this quickens the delivery process for those seeking 
                these combinations.
            
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the menu view and selection feature, Study Bites will require UMass Amherst 
                dining hall menu data. The web application will need to clearly convey the hours at which the dining hall 
                opens and closes, as well as the times at which the menu changes. In addition to expressing this information 
                to the user, the application will also need to limit the options available to said user. Users should not be 
                able to place orders for dining halls that are currently closed or are closing soon and should not be able 
                to place orders on menus that are no longer available or are changing soon. In the vein of time-sensitive menus, 
                Study Bites should allow users to view upcoming menus, giving students the foresight to determine what they 
                would like to eat or order later in the day. This future menu data can be extended to the creation of a pre-order 
                feature, in which individuals place orders to be delivered hours after they place them.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such large volumes of data being stored across so many categories, a thorough but 
                intuitive database structure will be pivotal. The information must be not only well-structured but also updated 
                in a runtime-friendly manner at points of low app use. For example, when no dining halls are open such as shortly 
                after midnight, the menus for the following day can be retrieved. With the storage of user data, the respect and 
                security of data becomes a major concern. Local laws must be abided by concerning the dispensing of user data. 
                Beyond legal responsibilities, it is the moral responsibility of Study Bites to be transparent about what user 
                data is stored, in what manner it is kept, and how much control the user has over its storage.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every current and former student has been in a similar scenario—
                they’re in their tiny dorm room, the sun has set, and they need to eat. Their fridge, if they 
                even own one, has no food in it, and they have no car on campus to go shopping. The only way to 
                get the food they need is to spend an exorbitant amount on DoorDash, or walk to a dining hall 
                if any are open. The only problem is, these options are not always possible. The student might 
                be sick, injured, or cramming an assignment, and they can’t afford a $20 delivery fee from DoorDash 
                or to waste 20 minutes in line just because it’s Cajun night at Frank. Our app, Study Bites, aims 
                to provide a solution to this problem. It allows students to choose from any food location on campus, 
                make an order, and have that order delivered directly to their dorm. This simple process could save 
                a lot of people an incredible amount of trouble.  
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the so-called ‘frat-flu’ to COVID-19, it is inevitable that students 
                will contract illnesses during their time at UMass Amherst, even if they take every means of avoiding 
                sickness. Students can request excusals from their classes, but the same cannot be said about their 
                meals. Similarly, students at UMass Amherst are encouraged to engage in extracurriculars—either their 
                own hobbies or university-sponsored activities. Many of these undertakings come with a risk of physical 
                injury, which can restrict students' abilities to navigate the campus. For some students, what stands 
                between their dorm and food is multiple sets of stairs, the much-feared Orchard Hill, and too many yards to count. 
                The time-honored solution to these difficulties has been asking friends to retrieve food for their injured 
                companions, but what if UMass Minutemen all treated each other as friends in this regard? What if sick students 
                could remain isolated in their dorms and injured students could take the much-needed time in bed to heal properly 
                by getting food delivered to their door, all with the promise that they will pay back the favor to their community? 
                With Study Bites, these once-hypotheticals are made possible. If a student is already at a dining hall, ready to 
                walk back to their dorm with a full stomach or a bag of food from Grab-n-Go, they can check Study Bites to see if 
                there are any food requests from their current dining hall to their dorm. The aforementioned student can now get 
                an extra serving, carry it to their already-determined destination, and give it to the correct student, messaging 
                them if needed. By getting this second portion for a student, they earn a token—and more than a token of appreciation. 
                The Study Bite token can be redeemed on the web app so that the good samaritan can get food delivered to their 
                desired location the next time they see fit. In this situation, a meager investment of effort by bringing additional 
                food to their dorm allowed the student to get food delivered to them the next time they need a meal and are 
                preoccupied, regardless of budget. 
                
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study Bites solves two problems at once—the tradeoff of food versus time, and the shortage of 
                good deeds on campus—all while running on UMass Amherst Minutemen’s selflessness.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project, being a web application, is a culmination of much of my computer science education. I took an 
                HTML class in high school that introduced me to building websites and gave me a relatively firm background 
                for this CS-326. Additionally, CS-220 was an excellent addition to my skill set, teaching me  how to code 
                using concise and effective javascript. During the Spring 2023 semester, I worked on two simultaneous group 
                projects in CS-325 and CICS-256, and ended up being the de-facto leader in both. This gave me substantial 
                experience in working with my peers, as well as a more valuable lesson when one of my group mates did precisely 
                zero work on one of them. Additionally, in CS-325: Human-Computer Interaction, our final project was set to be 
                a prototype for a mobile or web application. Because the class had no app development prerequisites, the final 
                project only had to be a rough prototype, with a well-realized front-end, but little to no real functionality. 
                However, because the class was made up of mostly computer science majors, my professor decided to change the 
                final project requirements to a fully realized application. Over the next two weeks, the class ended up convincing 
                the professor that this was unreasonable, since backend development was neither a prerequisite nor taught in the 
                class. The professor, however, was surprised that none of us yet had the skills required to complete an application 
                over the course of the semester. It made me realize, as well, how little I knew about actual development, outside 
                of the typical weekly assignments and occasional surface-level project. My previous classes have been very successful 
                at teaching the basics of computer science and development, but I realized that I had a lot more to learn.

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of just schoolwork, and spurred on by my experiences, over the Summer of 2023 
                I worked on a web application using the React framework at a software development company. The work I did there 
                expanded on both of these concepts even more, and greatly increased my experience working with both HTML and 
                javascript. I began work on this application relatively late in development, and my work was far more front-end than 
                back-end. However, the experience was valuable, and the application went out to clients the following October.

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this group project, being a web application from scratch, is an opportunity to synthesize 
                multiple different parts of my education into one place. I will be able to truly develop something from scratch, 
                and use the fundamentals from my previous computer science classes along with my experience in real-world development.
                These aspects together allow me to integrate my major-oriented skills in computer science with my more general 
                education, which will result in a thorough and fully interactive final project in Study Bites.
