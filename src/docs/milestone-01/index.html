                UMass Study Bites is a food delivery app that is targeted toward students on the UMass Amherst 
                flagship campus and that deals exclusively with on-campus dining hall food. Study Bites will allow 
                users to order food from a given dining hall through a live UMass menu, and then have the food 
                delivered to their dorm. This project aims to be an all-in-one, intuitive place for students to 
                find out what is being served around campus, as well as get that food brought to them in an organized 
                way. Right now, if you are a student who is sick or injured in a significant way, it can be very 
                difficult to get to a dining hall, and in the process, you risk getting others sick or further injuring 
                yourself. This app intends to help students in these situations get their food safely and without 
                all the hassle. Additionally, during midterms and finals, waiting in dining hall lines eats up a 
                lot of potential studying time. This app helps students get food conveniently, allowing them to 
                spend their limited time on more demanding tasks.

                <h2>Application Parts</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="main-body">
                The first critical component of Study Bytes is the selection of a delivery 
                location from a predetermined list. At release, Study Bytes will limit delivery 
                locations to UMass Amherst dining halls, with the potential to scale the app 
                to other on-campus locations if popularity increases.
                A second major part of Study Bites is the dining hall selection. Our app will pull 
                both the Grab-n-Go and dine-in menus of all 4 dining halls. The user ordering 
                food will be able to click 
                any of these locations and easily view these menus. The menus will be consistent with 
                the UMass Dining app’s listings, extracting their data from a common source. From this 
                menu, the receiving user can select up to four desired items from their specified 
                dining hall—thereby abiding by UMass Grab-n-Go restrictions and ensuring that the 
                deliveries are reasonably sized for carrying.
                Another critical component of the app is the delivery service. Because UMass dining 
                halls largely rely on dining plans that are accessed via UCards, involving non-UMass 
                Amherst students in the system adds an unneeded layer of complexity. Similarly, 
                converting the meal swipes expended in picking up food to USD that the ordering user 
                pays becomes a difficult conversion. Instead, Study Bites relies on a token system, 
                where all users start with one token. Delivering food to a student allows users to gain 
                tokens, which they can then spend to get food delivered to themselves. Securing this 
                UMass-Amherst student token system is the requirement that Study Bites accounts be made 
                with a UMass email, thereby ensuring that students don’t create multiple accounts for 
                free tokens, especially those without meal plans. Delivery to the correct student is 
                confirmed by the displaying of the recipient’s UCard.

                <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="main-body">
                Due to the account system of Study Bites, the web app will need 
                to handle user data. Necessary data will include the student’s 
                name as appears on their UCard so that deliveries are given to the 
                correct student, the student’s phone number and student email to 
                send connect deliverers and recipients, the student’s commonly 
                used addresses, and the number of orders they have placed and 
                delivered. Only essential user information will be stored, with Study 
                Bites taking special care to not store sensitive information, such as 
                Spire IDs. Even with this avoidance of highly sensitive information, 
                Study Bites will need to take special precautions to keep user data 
                secure and to use the information responsibly. Study Bites will also 
                provide an avenue through which users can have their stored information 
                removed and their accounts deleted, thus ensuring that the web app is 
                non-committal.
                Because Study Bites revolves around delivering food between specified locations, 
                its user interface is highly enhanced by the use of locational data. With Study 
                Bites, this data will manifest itself on the user interface through a map feature, 
                likely implemented through an API such as that provided by Google Maps. Through 
                this map feature, users can navigate through delivery location and dining hall options 
                in a more visually appealing manner than scrolling through a long list. This map 
                also allows for the future implementation of delivery time estimates. Because geocoding, 
                the conversion of addresses or location names into coordinate values, is a process 
                that many providers charge for, the enumerated addresses of pick-up and delivery 
                locations will be geocoded before release. In the future, a larger budget may allow 
                for individuals to pin delivery locations or use their current location as the delivery point.
                Study Bites can also use trends in order data to improve its user experience. By 
                keeping a list of orders placed within a determined length of time, Study Bites can 
                observe what menu items have been popular at dining halls. Through this feature, 
                students who regularly order said popular item will have an easier time adding it 
                to their order, and students who may not have tried it before will be encouraged 
                to try what other students are recommending. Similarly, Study Bites can note what 
                menu items are often ordered in combination. Whether the items are ordered together 
                because the flavors pair well—such as a burger and fries—or because they combine to 
                form one dish—such as cereal and milk—this quickens the delivery process for those 
                seeking these combinations.
                For the menu view and selection feature, Study Bites will require UMass Amherst 
                dining hall menu data. The web application will need to clearly convey the hours 
                at which the dining hall opens and closes, as well as the hours at which the menu 
                changes. In addition to expressing this information to the user, the application 
                will also need to limit the options available to said user. Users should not be 
                able to place orders for dining halls that are currently closed or are closing soon 
                and should not be able to place orders on menus that are no longer available or are 
                changing soon. In the vein of time-sensitive menus, Study Bites should allow users 
                to view upcoming menus, thereby giving students the foresight to determine what 
                they would like to eat or order later in the day. This future menu data can be extended 
                to the creation of a pre-order feature, in which individuals place orders to be 
                delivered hours after they place them.
                With such large volumes of data being stored across so many categories, a thorough 
                but intuitive database structure will be pivotal. The information must be not only 
                well-structured but also updated in a runtime-friendly manner at points of low app 
                use. For example, when no dining halls are open such as shortly after midnight, the 
                menus for the following day can be retrieved. With the storage of user data, the 
                respect and security of data becomes a major concern. Local laws must be abided by 
                concerning the dispensing of user data. Beyond legal responsibilities, it is the 
                moral responsibility of Study Bites to be transparent about what user data is 
                stored, in what manner it is kept, and how much control the user has over its storage.
