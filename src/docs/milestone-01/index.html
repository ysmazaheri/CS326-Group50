                    UMass Study Bites is a food delivery app that is targeted toward students on the UMass Amherst
                    flagship campus and that deals exclusively with on-campus dining hall food. Study Bites will
                    allow users to order food from a given dining hall through a live UMass menu, and then have the
                    food delivered to their dorm. This project aims to be an all-in-one, intuitive place for students
                    to find out what is being served around campus, as well as get that food brought to them in an organized
                    way. Right now, if you are a student who is sick or injured in a significant way, it can be very
                    difficult to get to a dining hall, and in the process, you risk getting others sick or further injuring
                    yourself. This app intends to help students in these situations get their food safely and without all
                    the hassle. Additionally, during midterms and finals, waiting in dining hall lines eats up a lot of
                    potential studying time. This app helps students get food conveniently, allowing them to spend their
                    limited time on more demanding tasks.

                </div>
                <div class="main-body">
                    The first critical component of Study Bites is the selection of a delivery location
                    from a predetermined list. At release, Study Bites will limit delivery locations to
                    UMass Amherst dining halls, with the potential to scale the app to other on-campus
                    locations if popularity increases.
                    <br>
                    A second major part of Study Bites is the dining hall food selection. Our app will pull
                    both the Grab-n-Go and dine-in menus of all 4 dining halls. The user ordering food will
                    be able to click any of these locations and easily view its corresponding menu. The menus
                    will be consistent with the UMass Dining app's current listings, extracting their data from
                    a common source. From this menu, the receiving user can select up to four desired items
                    from their specified dining hallâ€”thereby abiding by UMass Grab-n-Go restrictions and ensuring
                    that the deliveries are reasonably sized for carrying.

                    <br>
                    Another critical component of the app is the delivery service. Because UMass dining halls largely
                    rely on dining plans that are accessed via UCards, involving non-UMass Amherst students in the
                    system adds an unneeded layer of complexity. Similarly, converting the meal swipes expended in picking
                    up food to USD that the ordering user pays becomes a difficult conversion. Instead, Study Bites relies
                    on a token system, where all users start with one token. Delivering food to a student allows users to
                    gain tokens, which they can then spend to get food delivered to themselves. Securing this UMass-Amherst
                    student token system is the requirement that Study Bites accounts be made with a UMass email, thereby
                    ensuring that students don't create multiple accounts for free tokens, especially those without meal
                    plans. Delivery to the correct student is confirmed by the displaying of the recipient's UCard.

                <div class="main-title">
                    <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="main-body">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the account system of Study Bites, the web app will
                    need to handle user data. Necessary data will include the student's name as appears
                    on their UCard so that deliveries are given to the correct student, the student's phone
                    number, and student email to connect deliverers and recipients. Additionally, the app
                    will store students' commonly used addresses, and the number of orders they have placed
                    and delivered, to make future orders easier. Only essential user information will be
                    stored, with Study Bites taking special care to not store sensitive information, such as
                    Spire IDs. Even with this avoidance of highly sensitive information, Study Bites will need
                    to take special precautions to keep user data secure and to use the information responsibly.
                    Study Bites will also provide an avenue through which users can have their stored information
                    removed and their accounts deleted, thus ensuring that the web app is non-committal.

                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Study Bites revolves around delivering food between specified locations,
                    its user interface is highly enhanced by the use of locational data. With Study Bites, this data will
                    manifest itself on the user interface through a map feature, likely implemented through an API such as
                    that provided by Google Maps. Through this map feature, users can navigate through delivery location and
                    dining hall options in a more visually appealing manner than scrolling through a long list. This map also
                    allows for the future implementation of delivery time estimates. Because geocoding, the conversion of
                    addresses or location names into coordinate values, is a process that many providers charge for, the
                    enumerated addresses of pick-up and delivery locations will be preemptively geocoded before release. In
                    the future, a larger budget may allow for individuals to pin delivery locations or use their current location
                    as the delivery point.
                    Study Bites can also use trends in order data to improve its user experience. By keeping a list of orders
                    placed within a determined length of time, Study Bites can observe what menu items have been popular at
                    dining halls. Through this feature, students who regularly order said popular item will have an easier time
                    adding it to their order, and students who may not have tried it before will be encouraged to try what other
                    students are recommending. Similarly, Study Bites can note what menu items are often ordered in combination.
                    Whether the items are ordered together because the flavors pair wellâ€”such as a burger and friesâ€”or because
                    they combine to form one dishâ€”such as cereal and milkâ€”this quickens the delivery process for those seeking
                    these combinations.

                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the menu view and selection feature, Study Bites will require UMass Amherst
                    dining hall menu data. The web application will need to clearly convey the hours at which the dining hall
                    opens and closes, as well as the times at which the menu changes. In addition to expressing this information
                    to the user, the application will also need to limit the options available to said user. Users should not be
                    able to place orders for dining halls that are currently closed or are closing soon and should not be able
                    to place orders on menus that are no longer available or are changing soon. In the vein of time-sensitive menus,
                    Study Bites should allow users to view upcoming menus, giving students the foresight to determine what they
                    would like to eat or order later in the day. This future menu data can be extended to the creation of a pre-order
                    feature, in which individuals place orders to be delivered hours after they place them.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such large volumes of data being stored across so many categories, a thorough but
                    intuitive database structure will be pivotal. The information must be not only well-structured but also updated
                    in a runtime-friendly manner at points of low app use. For example, when no dining halls are open such as shortly
                    after midnight, the menus for the following day can be retrieved. With the storage of user data, the respect and
                    security of data becomes a major concern. Local laws must be abided by concerning the dispensing of user data.
                    Beyond legal responsibilities, it is the moral responsibility of Study Bites to be transparent about what user
                    data is stored, in what manner it is kept, and how much control the user has over its storage.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every current and former student has been in a similar scenarioâ€”
                    they're in their tiny dorm room, the sun has set, and they need to eat. Their fridge, if they
                    even own one, has no food in it, and they have no car on campus to go shopping. The only way to
                    get the food they need is to spend an exorbitant amount on DoorDash, or walk to a dining hall
                    if any are open. The only problem is, these options are not always possible. The student might
                    be sick, injured, or cramming an assignment, and they can't afford a $20 delivery fee from DoorDash
                    or to waste 20 minutes in line just because it's Cajun night at Frank. Our app, Study Bites, aims
                    to provide a solution to this problem. It allows students to choose from any food location on campus,
                    make an order, and have that order delivered directly to their dorm. This simple process could save
                    a lot of people an incredible amount of trouble.
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the so-called â€˜frat-flu' to COVID-19, it is inevitable that students
                    will contract illnesses during their time at UMass Amherst, even if they take every means of avoiding
                    sickness. Students can request excusals from their classes, but the same cannot be said about their
                    meals. Similarly, students at UMass Amherst are encouraged to engage in extracurricularsâ€”either their
                    own hobbies or university-sponsored activities. Many of these undertakings come with a risk of physical
                    injury, which can restrict students' abilities to navigate the campus. For some students, what stands
                    between their dorm and food is multiple sets of stairs, the much-feared Orchard Hill, and too many yards to count.
                    The time-honored solution to these difficulties has been asking friends to retrieve food for their injured
                    companions, but what if UMass Minutemen all treated each other as friends in this regard? What if sick students
                    could remain isolated in their dorms and injured students could take the much-needed time in bed to heal properly
                    by getting food delivered to their door, all with the promise that they will pay back the favor to their community?
                    With Study Bites, these once-hypotheticals are made possible. If a student is already at a dining hall, ready to
                    walk back to their dorm with a full stomach or a bag of food from Grab-n-Go, they can check Study Bites to see if
                    there are any food requests from their current dining hall to their dorm. The aforementioned student can now get
                    an extra serving, carry it to their already-determined destination, and give it to the correct student, messaging
                    them if needed. By getting this second portion for a student, they earn a tokenâ€”and more than a token of appreciation.
                    The Study Bite token can be redeemed on the web app so that the good samaritan can get food delivered to their
                    desired location the next time they see fit. In this situation, a meager investment of effort by bringing additional
                    food to their dorm allowed the student to get food delivered to them the next time they need a meal and are

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study Bites solves two problems at onceâ€”the tradeoff of food versus time, and the shortage of
                    good deeds on campusâ€”all while running on UMass Amherst Minutemen's selflessness.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project, being a web application, is a culmination of much of our computer science
                    education. Both Ian and Said took an HTML class in high school that introduced them to building websites and gave
                    them a relatively firm background for this CS-326, while Vrishabhâ€™s past work experience at Zephyr Rugs has
                    provided him with a similar background. Additionally, CS-220 has been an excellent addition to the teamâ€™s skill
                    set, teaching all members to develop concise and effective Javascriptâ€”a skill that will be pivotal for developing
                    Study Bites.

                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian and Said have also worked in professional environments over the Summer of 2023, with
                    Ian working in a team of 3 to build a web application in the React framework. Said worked independently at a
                    Boston-based private equity firm to modernize their client management system with Vaadin. This project will allow
                    the experience of real-world development to be reflected in coursework, synthesizing both academic and professional work.

                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other academic group projects, of which all 3 group members have experience, have provided
                    valuable experience in planning and dividing up the required work for developing this application. Ian, Said, and
                    Vrishabh have all been left out to dry by slacking group members in the past, and have committed to contributing
                    a valuable effort to Study Bites.
